### Hi there 👋

#### I'm a Software Engineer Student studying in Berlin, Germany.

- 🏢 I'm currently working at **TINCON e.V.**
- ⚙️ I use daily: `.php`, `.js`, `.html`, `.css`, `.psd`,  
passionately learning new things about: docker, elixir, react & typescript.
- 🌍 I'm deeply dedicated working towards **Climate Justice**  
which represents an intersectional movement, which goes beyond climate action to include queer-feminist, anti-fascist, anti-racist and anti-colonialist emphases.
